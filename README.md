# VolumeExtension
A program that is only needed by those with too many noisy tabs, and even they wouldn't want to use it â€“ a ridiculous program :)

### What's this?
- This is just a panel that allows you to control it from a single center, if you use too many tabs like me and have sound problems with them.

### REMEMBER!!
- When you add this, adjust the sound settings only from this panel manually, do not right-click to mute on the tabs. It goes against the purpose of the program, and it gets confusing, so stick to that :)
