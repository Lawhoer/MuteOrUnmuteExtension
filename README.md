# MuteOrUnmuteExtension
A program that is only needed by those with too many noisy tabs, and even they wouldn't want to use it â€“ a ridiculous program :)

### What's this?
- This is just a panel that allows you to control it from a single center, if you use too many tabs like me and have sound problems with them.
### REMEMBER!!
- When you add this, adjust the sound settings only from this panel manually, do not right-click to mute on the tabs. It goes against the purpose of the program, and it gets confusing, so stick to that :)
- And don't forget, this panel doesn't stop the videos on the tabs, it only mutes the sound of that tab. Unfortunately, Chrome doesn't grant much power beyond muting the tab's sound, unlucky :(
